Online study? Possibly doable, but not worth it for me!</p><p name="9d56" id="9d56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This article contains two parts: my pains and gains throughout the semester.</p></div></div></section><section name="0421" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="4320" id="4320" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Pains</h3><figure name="20eb" id="20eb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*SnQkc7PXMIIvnTEX.jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="546" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SnQkc7PXMIIvnTEX.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Time difference</figcaption></figure><p name="05d2" id="05d2" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span>he first and most furious issue with remote learning is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">time difference</strong>. I‚Äôm living in Vietnam, which is literally half an Earth away from USA. So my schedule would start from 9:00 pm to 3:00 am local time üò¢. Before the semester started, I told myself that I was a nocturnal who would sleep at 2 or 3 am, so I should be fine. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And I was NOT. </strong>Converting time alone was an annoying task. You had to always have 2 timezone in your head to organize your tasks and collaborate with others. And hey, watch out for Daylight Saving Time ‚ö†Ô∏è. In addition, studying remotely means that you have to adapt to the life of both timezone. Classes stopped at 3:00 am did not mean that I would be sleeping at 3:00 am. I had homework to do, I had to socialize, I had to go to office hours. So sleeping time during the semester really varied. There were even days that I slept at 0:00 am but also days that I slept at 10:00 am. This was brutally unhealthy, I was craving to take a nap‚Ä¶, and at some point, I even slept during lectures due to exhaustion. I also had to adapt to my family schedules, avoid sleeping in the ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù time. The apartment on top of mine was drilling during the day, and it was a disaster.</p><p name="7526" id="7526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">My advice here is to make a plan or somewhat a pattern of sleeping.</strong></p><figure name="bfad" id="bfad" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*wJPoj-nhFXhLlVWC.jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wJPoj-nhFXhLlVWC.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Isolation</figcaption></figure><p name="33a4" id="33a4" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap">P</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ersonally</strong>, I felt that it was really challenging to make new friends in a virtual environment. In Zoom meetings, no one wanted their camera on! And it was hard to really be closed to someone just by talking to them over the internet. At some points during the semester, I was isolated, not connecting well with local friends, not making many new remote friends. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">(Disclaimer alert: </strong>I‚Äôm an introvert.) Whatsoever, I did try really hard to connect with other students by joining clubs, working on projects together, participating in student programs, etc. Still I struggled socializing, I barely talked to other teammates after the events were over. Fortunately, I did make one closed friend, and I would not have made it through the semester without him.</p><p name="e255" id="e255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other things that I struggled with were difficulty in managing information from course websites (10 websites in total for 6 classes üòÖ), office hour queue took forever, etc. It would be way too long to list all of them!</p><p name="48eb" id="48eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I would usually not recommend others to study online like this.</strong> Given the above-mentioned issues, it is really likely that someone might suffer from mental breakdown or something like that doing school remotely. However, if you truly believe that these 2 main issues that I mentioned will not be a big deal, maybe give remote study a try! Some of my friends who went to different schools enjoyed their experience.</p><p name="c933" id="c933" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Ah, enough complaints! Looking back, I‚Äôm glad that I made it through the semester. I had some interesting accomplishment too, though did not quite match with my illusion before college.</p></div></div></section><section name="0d15" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="1ed5" id="1ed5" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Gains</h3><figure name="3915" id="3915" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*CiTlxha74AuId1Z1.jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CiTlxha74AuId1Z1.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">I enjoy Software Engineering</figcaption></figure><p name="8045" id="8045" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I‚Äôm more assured of my interest in computer science, particularly software engineering.</strong></p><p name="444e" id="444e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I took a class called Software Design Studio where students got to the surface of making a fully operating software. We learned a little about OOP, testing, and design patterns. I really enjoyed it despite the fact that assignments took me 12‚Äì24 hours weekly (Students complained like hell about the workload). It should not have taken that long, but I realized I love spending time redesigning my program in different ways and documenting my code.üëå See my <a href="https://github.com/phantuanminh/cinder-music-visual" data-href="https://github.com/phantuanminh/cinder-music-visual" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">final project</a>!

Although the class size was huge, Professor Woodley was very responsive and closed to his students.</p><p name="e920" id="e920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got into a bit of computer theory by taking Discrete Structure, most importantly learning some proofs. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to enjoy theory or not, but I did quite well in this class, almost got an A+. However, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the theory guy though. Noteworthy, I really appreciated Professor Fleck lecture style and how she made new concepts so simple!</p><p name="f291" id="f291" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I contributed to an Open Source Project for the first time thanks to HackIllinois Open Source Fellowship program.

Right now, I and one of my friend is still working on this project.

I really enjoy listening to music and play some classical pieces, especially pieces in the Romantic period. I play piano because I find peace doing so out of the stressful school work.
