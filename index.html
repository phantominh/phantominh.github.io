    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I like building stuffs, whether it is technology or community.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I grew up in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. "Bún Chả" is my favorite Viet dish. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I attended the chemistry specialized class at <a href="https://hsgs.edu.vn/">HUS High School for Gifted Students</a>. I did think of becoming a chemist, but eventually fell in love with programming.
      </li>
      <li>
        I took a gap semester before college and just do random stuffs. I organized big hackathons like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZClCyR0b5oo">HackCovy</a>, worked for a <a href="https://dasvision.vn/">tech startup</a>, interned at a big event organizing vendor, and occasionally edit videos. I'm amazed seeing technology's presence in all part of life, and that makes me want to become a computer scientist.
      </li>
      <li>
        I did my undergrad at <a href="https://illinois.edu/">UIUC</a> and worked across different areas of computer science. Had a lot of fun, met cool people, but eventually decided it was time to leave the cornfields. I wanted to do research and thought better ML models and better infrastructure for ML would be the next crucial thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        So here I am at Wisconsin. I will do some innovative work, become an expert in something, and make some real impact, then hopefully graduate :-).
